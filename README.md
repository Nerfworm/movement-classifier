# movement-classifier

This project aims to use inertial measurement units (IMU) positional tracking data to classify human movement in real time. <br>
I am trying to build it to be scalable for future classification tools like EEG, eye movement, and heart rate tracking.

## Technical Overview
### Technologies used:
- SteamVR
- OpenVr
